        <h1>Synthetix USD (sUSD) Depeg Crisis</h1>
        <h3>Timeline, Analysis, and Current Status</h3>
        <div class="date">Report Date: Saturday, April 26, 2025, 7:43:03 UTC</div>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The Synthetix protocol's native stablecoin, Synthetix USD (sUSD), has experienced a significant depeg from its intended $1 value, reaching as low as $0.66 in mid-April 2025. This report analyzes the timeline of events leading to this crisis, examines the structural causes, evaluates the protocol's response measures, and assesses the current state of sUSD as of April 26, 2025.</p>
        <p>Currently, sUSD is trading at approximately $0.88, representing a 12% deviation from its intended peg. The depeg situation has prompted significant concern within the cryptocurrency community, with some drawing parallels to the Terra UST collapse of 2022, though Synthetix has implemented several measures to stabilize the stablecoin and prevent a "death spiral" scenario.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Background: What is sUSD?</h2>
    <p>sUSD is a crypto-collateralized stablecoin native to the Synthetix protocol. Users lock up SNX tokens (Synthetix's native token) to mint sUSD, making its stability highly dependent on the market value of SNX. This design differs from fully algorithmic stablecoins like Terra's UST, as it maintains collateral backing, but still faces similar risks if collateral value significantly decreases.</p>

    <div class="timeline">
        <h2>Timeline of the sUSD Depeg Crisis</h2>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">January 1, 2025</div>
            <p>sUSD begins showing signs of instability, dropping to $0.96 from its $1 peg. This marks the beginning of persistent peg issues that would continue throughout Q1 2025.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">Early February 2025</div>
            <p>sUSD briefly recovers to $0.99, providing temporary relief. However, prices continued to fluctuate throughout February before somewhat stabilizing in March.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">March 20, 2025</div>
            <p>According to later statements from Synthetix team, this date marks when sUSD began its more serious depeg phase, coinciding with implementation of structural changes in the protocol.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 1, 2025</div>
            <p>sUSD drops to $0.91, raising serious concerns. Rob Schmitt, co-founder of Cork Protocol, publicly warns about potential "death spiral scenario" risks for sUSD, noting similarities to Terra's UST collapse while highlighting key differences in collateralization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 2, 2025</div>
            <p>Synthetix founder Kain Warwick addresses the volatility concerns, explaining that the primary driver of sUSD buying had been removed and "new mechanisms are being introduced but in this transition there will be some volatility." He emphasizes that sUSD is not an algorithmic stablecoin but a "pure crypto collateralized stable" that can drift from its peg.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 10, 2025</div>
            <p>sUSD falls to a five-year low of $0.83, intensifying market concerns. The price drop coincides with general market downturns affecting multiple stablecoins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 18, 2025</div>
            <p>sUSD continues its downward trend, reaching new all-time lows, trading as low as $0.66 before rebounding slightly to $0.70. A Synthetix spokesperson tells Cointelegraph that the volatility is driven by "structural shifts" after the SIP-420 launch, a proposal that shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself.</p>
            <p>Synthetix introduces the "sUSD 420 Pool," a new staking mechanism that rewards participants with a share of 5 million SNX tokens over 12 months if they lock their sUSD for a year in the pool.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 21, 2025</div>
            <p>Synthetix founder Kain Warwick threatens SNX stakers with "the stick" if they don't participate in the newly launched staking mechanism to fix the sUSD depeg. He acknowledges that the staking UI is "very manual" and that they will "ratchet up the pressure" on stakers if there isn't enough momentum once the UI goes live.</p>
            <p>Warwick emphasizes that "SNX stakers are still very much responsible for the health of the system" and that begins with maintaining the sUSD peg. He notes that the "collective net worth of SNX stakers is like multiple billions" and that they have the resources to solve the problem if they "dial in the incentives."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 23, 2025</div>
            <p>Synthetix rolls out additional incentives to restore the peg:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Liquidity rewards: sUSD/sUSDe LP on Convex now yields up to 49.18% APY</li>
                <li>Infinex deposit rewards: 16,000 OP/week for users depositing over 1,000 sUSD (6-week campaign)</li>
                <li>420 Pool staking: Lock sUSD for 1 year to earn from a 5M SNX reward pool</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Kain Warwick publishes a post on Mirror proposing a solution to the sUSD depeg, emphasizing that SNX stakers must take responsibility by participating in sUSD staking. He reveals that there is approximately $100M of SNX in the 420 pool backing ~$50M in debt and proposes requiring SNX stakers to deposit a minimum of $5M into the pool to continue receiving benefits from the debt jubilee initiated by the 420 pool launch.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 24, 2025</div>
            <p>South Korean exchanges Upbit and Bithumb suspend deposits for Synthetix (SNX) tokens after the Digital Asset Exchange Alliance (DAXA) designates SNX as a "cautionary item" due to risks associated with the sUSD depeg.</p>
            <p>Upbit cites concerns about potential volatility as SNX is used as collateral for sUSD and notes a "lack of use cases for the asset" that could cause investor losses. Bithumb also adds a cautionary tag to SNX tokens but indicates restrictions could be lifted if the underlying issues are resolved.</p>
            <p>Other South Korean exchanges, Korbit and Coinone, publish investor alerts to caution traders about SNX.</p>
            <p>Despite these negative developments, sUSD prices increase by 27%, briefly reaching $0.87, though still well below the $1 peg.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-date">April 26, 2025 (Current Status)</div>
            <p>As of today's report date, sUSD is trading at approximately $0.88, showing modest improvement but still significantly depegged from its $1 target. While there has been some recovery from the lows of $0.66, the stablecoin remains under pressure with its future stability uncertain.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="risk-section">
        <h2>Risk Analysis and Concerns</h2>
        <p>The sUSD depeg situation presents several risks that have been identified by market analysts and the Synthetix team:</p>

        <h3>Death Spiral Scenario</h3>
        <p>The most significant concern is the potential for a "death spiral" similar to what happened with Terra's UST in 2022. Rob Schmitt of Cork Protocol outlined this risk on April 1:</p>
        <blockquote>"The death spiral scenario remains the same though, if the value of SNX drops sufficiently, sUSD is no longer fully backed. If fear of sUSD being unbacked triggers users to redeem sUSD for SNX and sell this, it creates further downwards pressure on SNX, creating a cascading deleveraging event."</blockquote>

        <h3>Mitigating Factors</h3>
        <p>Despite these concerns, several factors may prevent a complete collapse:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Synthetix's $30 million treasury, which holds about half of the outstanding sUSD debt</li>
            <li>The implementation of the sUSD 420 Pool staking mechanism</li>
            <li>The crypto-collateralized nature of sUSD (as opposed to purely algorithmic)</li>
            <li>The various incentive programs launched to encourage liquidity and stabilization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Structural Issues</h3>
        <p>The Synthetix team has attributed the depeg to "structural shifts" following the launch of SIP-420, which changes how debt risk is managed in the protocol. The primary driver of sUSD buying was removed, and new mechanisms are still being implemented, creating transitional volatility.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Synthetix's Response Strategy</h2>
    <p>The Synthetix team has outlined short, medium, and long-term plans to address the depeg:</p>

    <div class="current-status">
        <h2>Current Market Status</h2>
        <p>As of April 26, 2025, sUSD is trading at $0.88, representing a 12% deviation from its intended $1 peg. Key metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Market Cap: $31.42 million</li>
            <li>24-hour Trading Volume: $229,780</li>
            <li>Circulating Supply: 35.4 million sUSD</li>
            <li>Total Supply: 35.4 million sUSD</li>
            <li>Maximum Supply: 142.39 million sUSD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SNX, the collateral token for sUSD, is currently holding relatively stable despite the depeg concerns.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Comparison to Other Stablecoin Depegs</h2>
    <p>The sUSD situation shares some similarities with previous stablecoin depeg events but also has unique characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>USDC (March 2023):</strong> Depegged due to $3.3 billion in reserves being tied up with the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank. Unlike sUSD, USDC quickly recovered after regulatory intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>TrueUSD (January 2025):</strong> Fell below its $1 peg after holders cashed out hundreds of millions worth of TUSD for competitor stablecoin Tether.</li>
        <li><strong>Terra UST (May 2022):</strong> The most catastrophic stablecoin collapse in crypto history, which spiraled from a small depeg to complete collapse in days. While sUSD shares some design similarities, it has stronger collateralization and more active management by the protocol team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The sUSD depeg represents a significant challenge for the Synthetix ecosystem, but the team has responded proactively with multiple measures to stabilize the stablecoin. The situation reveals the inherent vulnerabilities in crypto-collateralized stablecoins and the importance of robust mechanisms to maintain the peg.</p>
    <p>While the depeg has persisted for several months and reached concerning lows in mid-April, recent improvements suggest the implemented measures may be having a positive effect. However, the stablecoin remains significantly below its intended peg, and market confidence has been damaged, as evidenced by the actions of South Korean exchanges.</p>
    <p>The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether Synthetix can fully restore sUSD's peg and user confidence. The successful implementation of the various incentive mechanisms and the response of SNX stakers to Kain Warwick's calls for action will likely determine the future viability of sUSD as a stablecoin in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
